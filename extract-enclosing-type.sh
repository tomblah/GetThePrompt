# extract-enclosing-type.sh
#
# This helper defines a function to extract the enclosing type
# (class, struct, or enum) from a given Swift file. It scans until
# it reaches the TODO instruction and returns the last encountered type.
#
# If no enclosing type is found (i.e. if the TODO is outside any type),
# it falls back to using the fileâ€™s basename (without the .swift extension)
# as the type name.
#
# Usage (when sourcing):
#   extract_enclosing_type <swift_file>
#
# When executed directly, it performs a quick test.
